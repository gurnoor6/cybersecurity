This is another injection problem. One of the comments on the site said to use command injection. A simple google search yielded https://ctf101.org/web-exploitation/command-injection/what-is-command-injection/ which shows ";ls" exmaple.
So in this case the code is that if you go to console and type c("hello"), it will show hello on the calculator screen. And when you press "=",a request is made to the server that returns whatever was written on calculator in the form of text. So what would be used will be most likely something like "echo ${whatever}". But since that contained ";", we could run two commands and print ls output instead of our input
